## New Year, New Beginning ðŸŽ‰

Welcome to my tech blog! This is the first article of 2025, and I'd like to take this opportunity to share my expectations and plans for the new year.

### 2024 in Review

Looking back at the past year, many exciting changes have happened in the tech world:

- **Continued AI Development**: Large language models like ChatGPT and Claude became more mature
- **Frontend Framework Evolution**: React, Vue, and Angular all had major updates
- **Cloud Technology Adoption**: Containerization and microservices architecture became mainstream
- **Development Tool Improvements**: AI-assisted tools like GitHub Copilot and Claude Code enhanced development efficiency

### 2025 Technology Outlook

For 2025, I'm particularly interested in these technology trends:

#### 1. Deep Integration of AI with Development Work
```javascript
// AI-assisted code generation will become more precise
function generateOptimizedCode(requirements) {
  // AI will understand more complex requirements
  return aiAssistant.generateCode(requirements);
}
```

#### 2. Practical Applications of Web3 Technology
- Real-world implementation of blockchain technology
- Popularization of decentralized applications (DApps)
- Innovative applications of NFTs and digital assets

#### 3. Rise of Edge Computing
